# ProGen GraphQl Apollo server
This is the middle layer of the ProGen application. This part of the application 
handles the communication between the backend **ProGen API** and the frontend **ProGen Frontend**.

### Code Quality
To fix the code quality run the command `yarn formatlint:fix`. Then you might have to fix some issues. 
The project is using a combination of prettier and eslint for code quality. 

### Scripts
The command `yarn types` generates typescript based on the type defs. Therefor always run this command
when updating type defs and use the autogenerated typescript interfaces etc for typing. 

### Pipeline
The pipeline is currently setup for gitlab and checks the code quality of the project.

### Production
The project is compiled by the build command triggering `tsc`. The start command is for production and starts server.js 
in the generated dist folder.

### Src Root
In the root of Src folder you will find that api-gatherer which is used for the mutation api calls, the context which makes certain data accessible
in the program from the context, custom scalars for custom typs, dataloaders that registers all dataloaders, root mutations/resolvers/type-defs that merge
all created mutations/resolvers/type-defs and these are given to the instance of the apollo server in server.ts.
